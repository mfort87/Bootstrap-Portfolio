      <p>My name is Matthew Fort and I was born and raised on the Coastal Bend. I grew up in a small town called Rockport, TX and could often be found either playing sports or fishing with my friends.</p>

      <p>I graduated from Rockport-Fulton High School in 2005 and enrolled in school at Texas A&M University (after a short stint at UTSA).</p>

      <p>I graduated from Texas A&M in 2009 with a BS in Political Science and immediately moved to Austin, TX. I worked a few jobs here and there but currently work at a software company called ShipStation as a Technical Project Manager.</p>
